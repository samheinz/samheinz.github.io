  <h3>...Does this creature look cute to you?</h3>
  <p>If you answered yes, then you must really not be a huge fan of Australian biodiversity.</p>
  <h3>Why is my support for the the cane toad such a tragedy?</h3>
  <ul>
  		<li>THEY</li>
  		<li>ARE</li>
  		<li>TAKING</li>
  		<li>OVER</li>
  		<li>AUSTRALIA</li>
  	</ul>
  <p>Well... Not completely, but since their introduction to the continent in 1935 they have disrupted the natural ecological order of humerous habitats.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>A little background</h3>
  <p>Okay, so there were many before your time that thought that cane toads weren't all that bad.</p>
  <p>In fact, people had discovered that cane toads, when introduced into a habitat, could help curb the destruction of sugar cane crops by damaging insects.</p>
  <p>Native to America, they were introduced to Puerto Rico with much success; however, as some discovered after their introuction to Southern hemisphere, Puerto Rico and Australia aren't exactly the same.</p>
  <p>The reason the cane toad failed failed to create a golden age of Australian cane sugar production was that the insects attack the cane sugar there were different. These insects lived at the top of the plant, and the cane toad is --we'll spare the species from any expletives-- SUPER bad at jumping and cannot reach the top of the plant.</p>
  <p>Soon the cane toad started displacing other small predators as it has no natural predators itself on the continent.</p>
